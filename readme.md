# Assignment
## Test Logs Visualization with Graphs
As a company, I run ~2 Million Selenium test Network logs a day on cloud. Build an ability to graphically visualize the logs using a low end resource cloud architecture framework. This code should be able to package and run on self-hosted machines or on cloud with proxy settings and public APIs for subscribed customers. 


### Task instructions

The following are the prerequisites for the task: 
- Setup Selenium on your local machine 
- Write the script for opening the URL (https://www.lambdatest.com/) 
- Click on each header navigation items 
- Store the network logs generated on the browser to your local machine. 
- Repeat the process for more than 100 tests

The following are the requirements for the task: 
Use a lightweight graph library which can render a time series of 365 days on the x-axis and y-axis should be the following: 
- Total count of logs 
- Logs count/average stacked by log type (mime-type)
- Logs count/average stacked by log level (Status Codes) 
- Logs should be able to filter on the UI by any available key-value. 
- Logs should be searchable with a keyword using an API to fetch the results. 

You can use the recommended tech stack for developing this fullstack application: 
- ElasticSearch or any text search engine. 
- ReactJS 
- Go lang (or) Python for server 

### Task Expectations:
Students are expected to use the GitHub Flow when working on their task. This includes

1. Making changes on the auto generated `feedback` branch to complete the task
2. Using the auto generated **Feedback Pull Request** for review and submission
3. Using GitHub Discussions to ask any relevant questions regarding the project
