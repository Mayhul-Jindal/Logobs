 Developed a real-time logs pipeline which features cross-browser testing using selenium grid, network-logs aggregation/ingestion using kafka, notification-service and a search api backed by elasticsearch. All the microservices are written in go using no frameworks.

## Setup
Install [docker]() and [docker-compose]() first and then just   

```bash
docker-compose up 
```

Here are some short snippets of the urrent implementation.
