Well to be honest, I got so deep in the rabbit hole of  learning new stuff in the backend that I almost forgot to make a frontend for this project :) 

Well in this readme I have tried to cover **my reasoning** behind choosing such architecture and how much percentage I really completed to keep **full transparency**.

**TLDR** <img src="https://github.com/egonelbre/gophers/blob/master/icon/typing-furiously.gif?raw=true" width = "20" height = "20">

 Developed a real-time logs pipeline which features cross-browser testing using selenium grid, network-logs aggregation/ingestion using kafka, notification-service and a search api backed by elasticsearch. All the microservices are written in go using no frameworks.

## Setup
Install [docker]() and [docker-compose]() first and then just   

```bash
docker-compose up 
```

Here are some short snippets of the urrent implementation.
